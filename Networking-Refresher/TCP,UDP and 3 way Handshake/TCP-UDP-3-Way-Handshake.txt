TCP , UDP and 3 Way Handshake




• TCP also known as transmission controlled protocol , 
• UDP also known as User Datagram Protocol
• Both Tcp and Udp comes under 4th layer of Osi Model 
• TCP is a connection oriented protocol 
• whereas UDP is Connectionless Protocol
• When Compared then TCP is more reliable that UDP
• Mostly Websites have TCP as its much reliable 
• Example :- Http, https ,ftp,ssh .....
• And Most Video Streaming / Voice Calls / GMeets ... so on Uses UDP 
• Example :- DNS, VoiceOver IP



3- way handshake3-way



• TCP Works mostly on 3- way handshake
• First we send an SYN packet to the server/website
• Then We recive a SYN ACK packet from the server/website
• Then We again send an ACK packet to the server/website
• Example:- Friend1 says 'Hello How Are You' to Friend2 then Friend2 Reply 'Im Fine' to Friend1 then again Friend1 replys 'Ohh okayy'.
• Here We compare "Hello How Are You" to SYN packet , "Im Fine" to SYN ACK packet and "Ohh Okay" to ACK packet
• another Example In terms of PORT :-
• First we send a SYN packet asking to establish connection to PORT 443 to the server/website , then if the PORT 443 is free and is open for connection then it Sends back a SYN ACK packet Saying that yes its Availble for connection and then we again send a ACK packet To Connet to the PORT and to acknoledge.

• Here we can see that first we send a SYN packet to 2001:df2:1000:27::3(Which is IPv6) From PORT 32956 to PORT443
• then we recive an SYN,ACK packet from 2001:df2:1000:27::3 to My IPv6 Address From PORT 443 to 32956
• Again we send an ACK packet to 2001:df2:1000:27::3 From PORT 32965 to 443 
• Now the connection is establised Succesfully
• Remember there are more than 65000 ports availble for connectio
